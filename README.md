What should cain's user experience be?
type cain in the terminal and these things happen

	- input remapper bindings are put in folder
	- cinnamon settings are put in folder
	- micro bindings are put in folder
	- 














This is cain, it collects keybindings and settings in one place so you can quickily install them automatically later
