## NOTE: This program will switch your dotfiles and configs to mine.

### What is cain and what does it do?

cain stands for Collect And INstall

cain is my dotfiles / system files manager and installer

I made cain because I was having a hard time keeping track and updating individual repositories for configs


### REQUIREMENTS
Must have like python3, idk comes with linux mint
    
### How do I use cain (linux mint)

(One line install), paste into terminal
```
cd && sudo apt install git -y && git clone https://github.com/v3ai/cain && cd ~/cain && ./cain install
```


Your .bashrc will be changed to let you just type this command into the terminal
```
cain
```

### Don't move the cain directory from your home directory or it will break, should fix this soon.

Ascii art made with figlet -f Georgia11.flf cain (you may have to download that .flf file)
