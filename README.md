# What is cain and what does it do?






What should cain's user experience be?
type cain in the terminal and these things happen



Pre install
- git clone qcom to home directory
- run install script
- install script puts cain in /usr/local/bin
- install script downloads all required programs
- install script loads all keybindings


After installing:
- input remapper bindings are put in folder
- cinnamon settings are put in folder
- micro bindings are put in folder








This is cain, it collects keybindings and settings in one place so you can quickily install them automatically later
