## NOTE: This program will switch your dotfiles and configs to mine.

### What is cain and what does it do?

cain stands for Collect And INstall

Think of cain like a little robot that helps you keep track of dotfiles, keybindings, and desktop environment settings and easily install them on a new computer

I made cain because I was having a hard time keeping track and updating individual repositories for configs

Cain makes it easy to make your computer exactly like you like it on a fresh install and it does those two things

### REQUIREMENTS:
    Must have like python3, idk comes with linux mint
    
### How do I use cain (linux mint)

(One line install), paste into terminal
```
cd && sudo apt install git -y && git clone https://github.com/v3ai/cain && cd ~/cain && ./cain install
```


Your .bashrc will be changed to let you just type this command into the terminal
```
cain
```


### Don't move the cain directory from your home directory or it will break.

Ascii art made with figlet -f Georgia11.flf cain (you may have to download that .flf file)
