What should cain's user experience be?
type cain in the terminal and these things happen



Pre install
	- git clone qcom to home directory
	- run install script
	- install script puts cain in /usr/local/bin
	- install script downloads all required programs
	- install script loads all keybindings


After installing:
	- input remapper bindings are put in folder
	- cinnamon settings are put in folder
	- micro bindings are put in folder
	- 







This is cain, it collects keybindings and settings in one place so you can quickily install them automatically later
