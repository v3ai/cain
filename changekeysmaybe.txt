I'm thinking about changing some of my shortcut keys.

some will likely stay the same and some may be open to change 

def keep

Alt +
hjkl
uio
yp
,.
nm
sq
8

wrtdfzxbw`;/'[] Enter
windowskey(super_L) copilotkey()


(super_L) + (Key) can be mapped too


main things not being currently achieved
- want to open micro faster
- want to open booklister faster
maybe could use superL + key to map to less motion keys but like applications?


bunsure
